This is a car skin for the Skoda Favorit in [RSF Richard Burns Rally](https://www.rallysimfans.hu/rbr/index.php) based on my personal Skoda Forman I owned once and used as my everyday car for many years.

## Editing car liveries in RSF Richard Burns Rally

### Prerequisites

Download the .psd templates for the car skin you wish to edit: https://rbrtemplates.blogspot.com/2015/11/templates-for-ngp-cars.html

### Editing the car skin
Create a new skin by copying an existing skin folder from `\Richard Burns Rally\Cars\<CARNAME>\skins` in the same directory and name it your own.

Then you can switch to the skin from RSF Launcher:

Then open the .psd from the car template you downloaded previously of the car part you wish to modify in Photoshop and do the modifications to the psd, and then save the psd file.

Now load your modified psd file in NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter:
